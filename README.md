# alarm_clock

Alarm clock that accepts command line arguments for what time to go off. When it does it launches a Youtube video in your browser that will start playing.

Youtube videos will be chosen randomly. Command line arguments must be in the form of --hour H --minute M --p AM/PM.

Written in Python 3. My goal was to pracrice:

1. creating user friendly command line interfaces by using argparse;
2. writing test file using unittest;
3. manipulating datatime object.
